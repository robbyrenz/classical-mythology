## **Today's class**
### *More crazy Greek myth stories...*

- Nereids -> Nereus

## Poseidon **&** Amphritrite
- Initially, she didn't wanna marry Poseidon
- Atlas, who lived in North Africa, sheltered Amphritrite
- Poseidon enlisted Delphin to help find her
- He succeeded, and persuades her to marry Poseidon
- They have a son named Triton, who looks like the King from "The Little Mermaid"
- Triton is most famous child of the couple
- Delphin became a dolphin, I think

## **Poseidon**
- Not a merman!
- In a chariot pulled by hippocramps
- Has a trident
- He is the Lord of the Seas
- Seas can be calm and beautiful but also dangerous, just like Poseidon; he can quite an angry god
- Because of his anger, he butt heads with other dudes, like Polyphemus, who is actually his son
- He also butt heads with Athena
- Polyphemus is also a famous child of Poseidon
- Who was the father of Theseus

## **Children of the Sea**
- These are all descendent of the seas
- Two of most famous ones, Scylla & Charybdis
- Scylla use to suck up sailors from ships
- Scylla wasn't always a monster
- Poseidon tried to sleep with Scylla, Amphritrite found out, threw some shit at her, and she became a monster
- Iris falls under this category because *I'm not sure...*
- Harpies are bird-like mosters, swoop and take sailors away
- Graeae are old women who were very wise
- Medusa was the most famous of the Gorgons
- Poseidon slept with Medusa in Athena's temple, and when Athena found out, she turned her into the monster
- Medusa had 2 kids with Poseidon, named Pegasus (that horse) & Chrysaor (some monster)
- Cerberus is the 3-headed dog that guards the Underworld
- He is the great-grand child of Poseidon
- Lernaean Hydra's sibling is Cerberus
- It has multiple heads
- Third sibling is the Chimaera (the only female), bits of a snake, lion and goat, that can also breathes fire, for some reason
- Sphinx is also a monster that makes riddles, eats people
- Something about Oedipus...
- Nemean Lion, named after the place in Greece called Nemea
- First labour of Heracles is the skinning of Nemean Lion
- Ladon (it), a lot like the Hydra, multiheaded, famous for guarding a tree in Hesperides; that tree grows golden apples
- The very same apple in the Judgment of Paris
- Sea was the quickest and cheapest way to travel, that's how the Greeks spread their culture

# **Zeus, Hera and their Children**
- Zeus has a lot of children
- He is a complicated guy, had a tumultuous rise to power
- His siblings were eaten by Cronus, his father
- He was saved thanks to his mother
- I think he is obsessed to be in power
- He cheats on Hera, with everything
- But he can be overcome, he's not soo damn powerful 
- Ganymede is a young Trojan prince, whom Zeus was interested; he fancies him
- Ganymede's age may be 
- Zeus thinks he's will make a great cupbearer
- He then shows pity to him, a rarity (showing pity, 'cause Gods don't do that)

# **Hera**
- Juno is the Roman name
- Both Zeus's wife and sister
- She was not Zeus's first wife
- She is the Queen of the Gods
- Associated with peacocks
- She takes out her vengenance to the women who slept with Zeus
- Occasionally, she is kind to heroes

# **Zeus & Hera**
- I think their parents did not approve of their marriage
- Hebe is the opposite of Ganymede, she is the cupbearer of the Gods, she is the wife of Heracles, I think
- Eileithyia is another one 
- Leto

# **Zeus's & Hera's Children**
## Hephaestus
- His parents were both Zeus & Hera, both were unhappy with him
- Dionysus is his friend
- Another version is that Hera birthed him herself, out of jealously; he had no dad
- She threw him out of Mount Olympus because he was deformed
- He fell for a day
- In another version, Zeus & Hera were arguing, he steps in, & Zeus chucks him out of Mount Olympus
- Nymphs came to the rescue
- He developed his talents in metallorgy
- He hated his mom
- As time went by he decides to play a trick on his mom
- He made a throne, he ships it to her and she gets trapped due to the chains
- She can't escape, so they send Dionysus, who persuaded him to release her, by getting him drunk, I think
- He known for making weapons
- He also made Pandora, who was the first woman
- Sometimes associated with fire
- Made Achilles shield
- Married to Aphrodite
- She looked down upon him
- Nobody knows if they consummated their marriage

# **Ares**
- He did have sex with Aphrodite
