### Myth of Dionysus’ birth, his historical origins, his nature, and his worship - Semele
- Olympian god of wine, vegetation, pleasure, festivity, madness and wild frenzy.
- Depicted as either an older, bearded god or an effeminate, long-haired youth.
- His attributes included the thyrsos (a pine-cone tipped staff), a drinking cup and a crown of ivy.
- Usually accompanied by a troop of Satyrs and Mainades (wild female devotees).
- Dionysos was a son of Zeus and the princess Semele of Thebes.
- Semele was the daughter of Cadmus.
- During the course of her pregnancy, the god's jealous wife Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to appear before her in his full glory.
- Bound by oath, the god was forced to comply and she was consumed by the heat of his lightning-bolts.
- Zeus recovered their unborn child from her body, sewed him up in his own thigh, and carried him to term.
- After his birth from the thigh of Zeus, Dionysos was first entrusted to the care of Seilenos (Silenus) and the nymphs of Mount Nysa.
- And later to his aunt Ino, Semele's sister, and her husband Athamas.
- Hera was enraged when she learned of the boy's location and drove the couple mad, causing them to kill both their children and themselves.

### Dionysus and his worship in Euripides’ Bacchae
- The Bacchae is an ancient Greek tragedy, written by the Athenian playwright Euripides.
- The play begins before the palace at Thebes, with Dionysus telling the story of his birth and his reasons for visiting the city.
- Dionysus explains he is the son of a mortal woman, Semele, and a god, Zeus.
- Some in Thebes, he notes, don’t believe this story.
- In fact, Semele’s sisters, Autonoe, Agave, and Ino, claim it is a lie intended to cover up the fact that Semele became pregnant by some mortal.
- Dionysus reveals that he has driven the women of the city mad, including his three aunts, and has led them into the mountains to observe his ritual festivities.
- He has disguised himself as a mortal for the time being, but he plans to vindicate his mother by appearing before all of Thebes as a god, the son of Zeus, and establishing his permanent cult of followers.
- Dionysus exits to the mountains, and the chorus (composed of the titular Bacchae) enters.
- They perform a choral ode in praise of Dionysus.
- Then Tiresias, the blind and elderly seer, appears.
- He calls for Cadmus, the founder and former king of Thebes.
- The two old men start out to join the revelry in the mountains when Cadmus’ petulant young grandson Pentheus, the current king, enters.
- Disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress, he scolds them and orders his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in Dionysian worship, including the mysterious "foreigner" who has introduced this worship. Pentheus intends to have him stoned to death.
- The guards soon return with Dionysus himself in tow.
- Pentheus questions him, both skeptical of and fascinated by the Dionysian rites.
- Dionysus's answers are cryptic.
- Infuriated, Pentheus has Dionysus taken away and chained to an angry bull in the palace stable, But the god now shows his power.
- He breaks free and razes the palace with an earthquake and fire.
- Dionysus and Pentheus are once again at odds when a herdsman arrives from the top of Mount Cithaeron, where he had been herding his grazing cattle.
- He reports that he found women on the mountain behaving strangely: wandering the forest, suckling animals, twining snakes in their hair, and performing miraculous feats.
- The herdsmen and the shepherds made a plan to capture one particular celebrant, Pentheus' mother.
- But when they jumped out of hiding to grab her, the Bacchae became frenzied and pursued the men.
- The men escaped, but their cattle were not so fortunate, as the women fell upon the animals, ripping them to shreds with their bare hands.
- The women carried on, plundering two villages that were further down the mountain, stealing bronze, iron and even babies.
- When villagers attempted to fight back, the women drove them off using only their ceremonial staffs of fennel.
- They then returned to the mountain top and washed up, as snakes licked them clean.
- Dionysus, still in disguise, persuades Pentheus to forgo his plan to defeat and massacre the women with an armed force.
- He says it would be better first to spy on them, while disguised as a female Maenad to avoid detection.
- Dressing Pentheus in this fashion, giving him a thyrsus and fawn skins, Dionysus leads him out of the house.
- At this point, Pentheus seems already crazed by the god's power, as he thinks he sees two suns in the sky, and believes he now has the strength to rip up mountains with his bare hands.
- He has also begun to see through Dionysus' mortal disguise, perceiving horns coming out of the god's head; they exit to Cithaeron.
- A messenger arrives to report that once the party reached Mount Cithaeron, Pentheus wanted to climb an evergreen tree to get a better view and the stranger used divine power to bend down the tall tree and place the king in its highest branches.
- Then Dionysus, revealing himself, called out to his followers and pointed out the man in the tree.
- This drove the Maenads wild; led by Agave, his mother, they forced the trapped Pentheus down from the tree top, ripped off his limbs and his head, and tore his body into pieces.
- After the messenger has relayed this news, Agave arrives, carrying her son's bloodied head.
- In her god-maddened state, she believes it is the head of a mountain lion; she proudly displays it to her father, Cadmus, and is confused when he does not delight in her trophy, but is horrified by it.
- Agave then calls out for Pentheus to come marvel at her feat, and nail the head above her door so she can show it to all of Thebes.
- But now the madness begins to wane, and Cadmus forces her to recognize that she has destroyed her own son.
- As the play ends, the corpse of Pentheus is reassembled as well as is possible, the royal family devastated and destroyed.
- Agave and her sisters are sent into exile, and Dionysus decrees that Cadmus and his wife Harmonia will be turned into snakes and leads a barbarian horde to plunder the cities of Hellas.

### Dionysus & Apollo
- These two gods can be seen as representing rational (Apollonian) and irrational (Dionysian).
- Dionysus and Apollo are both the sons of Zeus and are gods of the creative arts in the Greek tradition.
- Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity.
- Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts.
- Apollo was associated with the Sun; he was the god of light, though his association with light, Apollo comes to represent justice, prophecy, and mental and moral purity, and is the god of healing.
- Because of his own salvation and stories about bringing Semele back to life, Dionysus is associated with death and resurrection.
- Apollo, like Dionysus, inspired poetry and music; unlike Dionysus, however, Apollo's poetry and music are elevated and orderly. He is sober, elegant, and eloquent; he plays the lyre; he is never ecstatic.
- More to add...?

### Dionysus & Ariadne
- Ariadne was the immortal wife of the wine-god Dionysus.
- Ariadne, a daughter of King Minos of Krete (Crete), assisted Theseus in his quest to slay the Minotauros (Minotaur) and then fled with the hero aboard his ship.
- When they landed on the island of Naxos Theseus abandoned her as she slept.
- It was then that Dionysos discovered her and made her his wife.

### Artemis vs. Aphrodite in Euripides’ Hippolytus.
- Hippolytus is an Ancient Greek tragedy by Euripides, based on the myth of Hippolytus, son of Theseus. 
- The summary of the play:
    - Theseus, the king of Athens, is serving a year's voluntary exile after having murdered a local king and his sons.
    - His illegitimate son is Hippolytus, whose birth is the result of Theseus's rape of the Amazon Hippolyta.
    - Hippolytus has been trained since childhood by the king of Troezen, Pittheus.
    - At the opening of the play Aphrodite, Goddess of love, explains that Hippolytus has sworn chastity and refuses to revere her.
    - Instead, he honours the Goddess of the hunt, Artemis. This has led her to initiate a plan of vengeance on Hippolytus.
    - When Hippolytus went to Athens two years previously Aphrodite inspired Phaedra, Hippolytus' stepmother, to fall in love with him.
    - Hippolytus appears with his followers and shows reverence to a statue of Artemis, a chaste goddess; a servant warns him about slighting Aphrodite, but Hippolytus refuses to listen.
    - The chorus, consisting of young married women of Troezen, enters and describes how Theseus's wife, Phaedra has not eaten or slept in three days.
    - Phaedra, sickly, appears with her nurse. After an agonizing discussion, Phaedra finally confesses why she is ill: she loves Hippolytus.
    - The nurse and the chorus are shocked. Phaedra explains that she must starve herself and die with her honour intact.
    - However, the nurse quickly retracts her initial response and tells Phaedra that she has a magical charm to cure her.
    - However, in an aside she reveals different plans.
    - The nurse, after making Hippolytus swear not to tell anyone, informs Hippolytus of Phaedra's desire and suggests that Hippolytus consider yielding to her.
    - He reacts with a furious tirade and threatens to tell his father, Theseus, everything as soon as he arrives.
    - Phaedra realizes disaster has fallen. After making the chorus swear secrecy, she goes inside and hangs herself.
    - Theseus returns and discovers his wife's dead body.
    - Because the chorus is sworn to secrecy, they cannot tell Theseus why she killed herself.
    - Theseus discovers a letter on Phaedra's body, which falsely asserts that she was raped by Hippolytus.
    - Enraged, Theseus curses his son either to death or at least exile.
    - To execute the curse, Theseus calls upon his father, the god Poseidon, who has promised to grant his son three wishes.
    - Hippolytus enters and protests his innocence but cannot tell the truth because of the binding oath that he swore.
    - Taking his wife's letter as proof, Theseus exiles his son.
    - The chorus sings a lament for Hippolytus.
    - A messenger enters and describes a gruesome scene to Theseus; as Hippolytus got in his chariot to leave the kingdom, a bull roared out of the sea, frightening his horses, which dashed his chariot among the rocks, dragging Hippolytus behind.
    - Hippolytus seems to be dying. The messenger protests Hippolytus' innocence, but Theseus refuses to believe him.
    - Theseus is glad that Hippolytus is suffering and about to die.
    - But then the goddess, Artemis, appears and rages at Theseus for killing his own son; she brutally tells him the truth: there was no rape, Phaedra had lied, his son was innocent.
    - Theseus is painfully devastated by this revelation.
    - Hippolytus is carried in physically battered and barely clinging to life.
    - In the last moments of the play, Hippolytus forgives his father, kind words are exchanged between father and son, and then Hippolytus dies.
- In this play:
    - all characters, the humans and gods, have imperfections and can be jealous and brutal in vengeance.
    - They all have blindnesses that keep them from seeing and understanding others with empathy and these blindnesses result in tragedy.
    - The play presents two goddesses who represent two aspects of the human spirit in conflict: One aspect is love, represented by Aphrodite and personified by Phaedra.
    - The second aspect is what the play refers to as sophrosyne, which is represented by Artemis and personified by Hippolytus.
    - Sophrosyne can be defined in part as being chaste, pure, clear-headed and untainted by sexual desire.

### Gilgamesh & Enkidu
- **Gilgamesh**, king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third man.
- He was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise, but he was a cruel despot.
- He lorded over his subjects, raped women, accomplished his building projects with forced labor, and his exhausted subjects groaned under his oppression.
- So basically, the gods heard his subjects’ pleas and decided to keep Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named **Enkidu**, who was as magnificent as Gilgamesh.
- Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s great friend, and Gilgamesh’s heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the gods, and he recorded them on stone tablets.
- The summary of the epic poem:
    - The epic begins with Enkidu. He lives with the animals, suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking at their watering places. A hunter discovers him and sends a temple prostitute into the wilderness to tame him.
    - When Enkidu sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him since he is no longer one of them; now, he is part of the human world.
    - Then the harlot teaches him everything he needs to know to be a man.
    - Enkidu is outraged by what he hears about Gilgamesh’s excesses, so he travels to Uruk to challenge him.
    - When he arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his way into a bride’s wedding chamber.
    - Enkidu steps into the doorway and blocks his passage and the two men wrestle fiercely for a long time, and Gilgamesh finally prevails.
    - After that, they become friends and set about looking for an adventure to share.
    - Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to steal trees from a distant cedar forest forbidden to mortals.
    - But a terrifying demon named **Humbaba**, the devoted servant of **Enlil**, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it.
    - The two heroes make the perilous journey to the forest, and, standing side by side, fight with the monster.
    - With assistance from **Shamash** the sun god, they kill him.
    - Then they cut down the forbidden trees, fashion the tallest into an enormous gate, make the rest into a raft, and float on it back to Uruk.
    - Upon their return, **Ishtar**, the goddess of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh, but Gilgamesh spurns her.
    - Enraged, the goddess asks her father, **Anu**, the god of the sky, to send the *Bull of Heaven* to punish him.
    - The bull comes down from the sky, bringing with him seven years of famine.
    - Gilgamesh and Enkidu wrestle with the bull and kill it.
    - The gods meet in council and agree that one of the two friends must be punished for their transgression, and they decide Enkidu is going to die.
    - He takes ill, suffers immensely, and shares his visions of the underworld with Gilgamesh.
    - When he finally dies, Gilgamesh is heartbroken.
    - Gilgamesh can’t stop grieving for Enkidu, and he can’t stop brooding about the prospect of his own death.
    - Exchanging his kingly garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he sets off into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, a sage that survived the Great Flood (think of him as the Mesopotamian Noah).
    - After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him how he might avoid death too.
    - Gilgamesh’s journey takes him to the twin-peaked mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain at night and rises out of the other side in the morning.
    - Utnapishtim lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes through it.
    - Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent.
    - After a harrowing passage through total darkness, Gilgamesh emerges into a beautiful garden by the sea.
    - There he meets **Siduri**, a veiled tavern keeper, and tells her about his quest; she warns him that seeking immortality is futile and that he should be satisfied with the pleasures of this world.
    - However, when she can’t turn him away from his purpose, she directs him to **Urshanabi**, the ferryman.
    - Urshanabi takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the *Waters of Death* to Utnapishtim.
    - Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the flood—how the gods met in council and decided to destroy humankind.
    - **Ea**, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods’ plans and told him how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his family and the seed of every living creature might escape.
    - When the waters finally receded, the gods regretted what they’d done and agreed that they would never try to destroy humankind again.
    - Utnapishtim was rewarded with eternal life.
    - Men would die, but humankind would continue.
    - When Gilgamesh insists that he be allowed to live forever, Utnapishtim gives him a test: if you think you can stay alive for eternity, he says, surely you can stay awake for a week.
    - Gilgamesh tries and immediately fails.
    - So Utnapishtim orders him to clean himself up, put on his royal garments again, and return to Uruk where he belongs.
    - Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim’s wife convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores youth.
    - Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him, planning to share it with the elders of Uruk.
    - But a snake steals the plant one night while they are camping.
    - As the serpent slithers away, it sheds its skin and becomes young again.
    - When Gilgamesh returns to Uruk, he is empty-handed but reconciled at last to his mortality.
    - He knows that he can’t live forever but that humankind will.
    - Now he sees that the city he had repudiated in his grief and terror is a magnificent, enduring achievement—the closest thing to immortality to which a mortal can aspire.

### Humbaba,
- But a terrifying demon named **Humbaba**, the devoted servant of **Enlil**, the god of earth, wind, and air, guards it.

### Ishtar and the bull of heaven
- Upon their return, **Ishtar**, the goddess of love, is overcome with lust for Gilgamesh, but Gilgamesh spurns her.
- Enraged, the goddess asks her father, **Anu**, the god of the sky, to send the *Bull of Heaven* to punish him.

### Utnapishtim
- Utnapishtim is a character in the Epic of Gilgamesh who is tasked by Ea to abandon his worldly possessions and create a giant ship to be called Preserver of Life.
- He was also tasked with bringing his wife, family, and relatives along with the craftsmen of his village, baby animals, and grains.

# Perseus
- He was the son of the Argive princess Danae who was locked away in a bronze chamber by her father Acrisius who lived in fear of a prophecy that he would one day be killed by her son.
- The god Zeus, however, infiltrated her prison in the guise of a golden shower and impreganted her.
- When Acrisius discovered the child, he placed the two in a chest and set them adrift at the sea.
- They were carried safely to the island of Seriphos where they were offered refuge by the kindly, fisherman Diktys.
- He is a kind fisherman whose brother, Polydectes, is the cruel ruler of the area.
- Polydectes soon wants to get rid of Perseus and marry Danaë, so he comes up with a plan to kill the young man: he convinces Perseus to go kill Medusa, the horrible Gorgon—an impossible feat for a mortal.
- The gods favor Perseus, however: he receives a mirrored shield from Athena, a magic sword from Hermes, and information on the location of the nymphs of the North—the only ones who know how to kill the Gorgon—from the Graiae, three supernatural gray sisters with only one eye among them. Perseus craftily steals the eye the Graiae share and refuses to return it until they help him.

### Graeae
- Graeae were two, some say three, sea hags (old women) who personified the white foam of the sea.
- They were grey-haired from birth and shared amongst themselves a single, detatchable eye and tooth.
- The hero Perseus stole these when he was searching for the Medusa, compelling the hags to reveal the location of their sister.

### Medusa – gorgons
- He eventually reaches the mystical land of the Hyperborean nymphs, who give him winged sandals that allow him to fly, a wallet that expands to hold anything, and a cap that makes its wearer invisible.
- With these, Hermes’ sword, and Athena’s mirrored shield—which enables him to avoid looking directly at the Gorgons, which would turns him to stone—he creeps into the Gorgons’ cave while they are sleeping.
- The two gods point out Medusa, the only mortal one.
- While looking at her in the mirror, Perseus chops off her head and puts it in the magic wallet, then begins to fly home.
- According to late classical poets, Medousa was once a beautiful woman who was transformed into a monster by Athena as punishment for lying with Poseidon in her shrine.
- Earlier Greek writers and artists, however, simply portray her as a monster born into a large family of monsters.

### Andromeda
- Along the way, he comes upon Andromeda, a princess who has been chained to a rock because her mother, Cassiopeia, has offended the gods.
- A sea serpent is about to eat Andromeda, but Perseus cuts off its head and takes Andromeda as his wife.
- He returns home to find that Polydectes has driven his mother and Dictys into hiding.
- Perseus goes to Polydectes’ palace where all the evil men of the kingdom are gathered.
- He marches into the meeting and reveals Medusa’s head, turning all the men to stone.
- He lives happily ever after but only after unwittingly fulfilling the prophecy of the Oracle: while participating in a discus-throwing contest, Perseus accidentally hits and kills a spectator, who is, unbeknownst to him, his grandfather Acrisius.

# Jason & Medea
- Medea was the daughter of King Aeetes of Colchis in Greek mythology, and wife of the mythical hero Jason.
- Jason was an ancient Greek mythological hero who was the leader of the Argonauts whose quest for the Golden Fleece featured in Greek literature.
- He was the son of Aeson, the rightful king of **Iolcos**.
- He was married to the sorceress Medea.
- He was also the great-grandson of the messenger god Hermes, through his mother's side.

### Golden Fleece
- The Golden Fleece is the fleece of the gold-haired winged ram, which was held in Colchis.
- The fleece is a symbol of authority and kingship.
- It figures in the tale of the hero Jason and his crew of Argonauts, who set out on a quest for the fleece by order of King Pelias, in order to place Jason rightfully on the throne of Iolcus in Thessaly.
- Through the help of Medea, they acquire the Golden Fleece.
- The story is of great antiquity and was current in the time of Homer (eighth century BCE).
- The tale of the Golden Fleece begins when Athamas, king of Orchomenus, had left his wife Nephele, to marry Ino, who was a daughter of Cadmus, the legendary king of Thebes.
- In order to secure that her own son would inherit the kingdom, Ino plotted the destruction of Athamas'son, Phrixus and his daughter Helle.
- To that end, she damaged all all of the seed grain in the kingdom.
- When the crops failed, messengers were sent to the Delphic oracle for guidance.
- Ino then bribed the returning messengers to change the oracle: Phrixus must be sacrificed!
- Athamas reluctantly agreed to heed the false oracle.
- But just as he raised the knife over his son on the altar, a wondrous, golden winged ram appeared, taking both Phrixus and Helle on his back to carry them away.
- While they were crossing the strait which separates Europe from Asia, the girl slipped and fell into the water.
- She was drowned; and the strait was named after her Hellespont (Sea of Helle).
- The boy came safely to land to the country of Colchis on the Black Sea.
- Although the Colchians were fierce people, they were kind to Phrixus and their king, Aetes, let him marry one of his daughters.
- In gratitude to god Zeus for having being saved, Phrixus sacrificed the ram and gave his golden fleece as a present, to king Aeetes.



### Jason, Aeson, & Pelias
- After the death of King Cretheus, the Aeolian **Pelias** usurped the Iolcan throne from his half-brother **Aeson** and became king of **Iolcus** in Thessaly (near the modern city of Volos).
- Because of this unlawful act, an oracle warned him that a descendant of **Aeolus** would seek revenge.
- Pelias put to death every prominent descendant of Aeolus he could, but spared Aeson because of the pleas of their mother Tyro.
- Instead, Pelias kept Aeson prisoner and forced him to renounce his inheritance.
- Aeson married **Alcimede**, who bore him a son named Jason.
- Pelias intended to kill the baby at once, but Alcimede summoned her kinswomen to weep over him as if he were stillborn.
- She faked a burial and smuggled the baby to Mount Pelion.
- He was raised by the centaur **Chiron**, the trainer of heroes.

- Pelias was presiding over a sacrifice to Poseidon with several neighboring kings in attendance.
- Among the crowd stood a tall youth in leopard skin with only one sandal.
- Pelias recognized that Jason was his nephew.
- He could not kill him because prominent kings of the Aeolian family were present.
- Instead, he asked Jason: "What would you do if an oracle announced that one of your fellow-citizens were destined to kill you?" Jason replied that he would send him to go and fetch the Golden Fleece, not knowing that Hera had put those words in his mouth.
- Jason learned later that Pelias was being haunted by the ghost of Phrixus.
- Phrixus had fled from Orchomenus riding on a divine ram to avoid being sacrificed and took refuge in Colchis where he was later denied proper burial.
- According to an oracle, Iolcus would never prosper unless his ghost was taken back in a ship, together with the golden ram's fleece.
- This fleece now hung from a tree in the grove of the Colchian Ares, guarded night and day by a dragon that never slept.
- Pelias swore before Zeus that he would give up the throne at Jason's return while expecting that Jason's attempt to steal the Golden Fleece would be a fatal enterprise.
- However, Hera acted in Jason's favour during the perilous journey.

    - Enraged, Heracles shot the centaur from the opposite shore with a poisoned arrow (tipped with the Lernaean Hydra's blood) and killed him.
    - As he lay dying, Nessus plotted revenge, told Deianira to gather up his blood and spilled semen and, if she ever wanted to prevent Heracles from having affairs with other women, she should apply them to his vestments.
    - Nessus knew that his blood had become tainted by the poisonous blood of the Hydra, and would burn through the skin of anyone it touched.
    - Later, when Deianira suspected that Heracles was fond of Iole, she soaked a shirt of his in the mixture, creating the poisoned shirt of Nessus.
    - Heracles' servant, Lichas, brought him the shirt and he put it on.
    - Instantly he was in agony, the cloth burning into him.
    - As he tried to remove it, the flesh ripped from his bones. Heracles chose a voluntary death, asking that a pyre be built for him to end his suffering.
    - After death, the gods transformed him into an immortal, or alternatively, the fire burned away the mortal part of the demigod, so that only the god remained.
    - After his mortal parts had been incinerated, he could become a full god and join his father and the other Olympians on Mount Olympus.
