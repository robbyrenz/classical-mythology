# Classical Mythology Exam Review
## Dr. Conor Whately
The exam is to be held on Wednesday, December 5, at 1:30-4:30pm, in 4M31.

- The first section of the exam will consist of a host of short answer questions for which you might, for example, have to match points from two columns, or answer multiple choice questions. This will occupy 40% of the exam.
- The second section of the exam will consist of quotations and images, ancient and modern, which will test your basic familiarity of the myths and texts we have covered. You will have to identify the various references included in the passages/images, and in some cases explain them. This will occupy 40% of the exam.
- The third section of the exam will consist of long answer questions. You might, for example, be given a scenario and be asked to find a solution using examples from myth. This will occupy 20% of the exam.

## NOTE:
- Ultimately, the exam is not cumulative, as you can see below
