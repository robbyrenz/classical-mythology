### nature, appearance of Aphrodite.
- depicted as a beautiful woman
- Aphrodite punished those who neglected her worship or despised her power, as well as others in which she favoured and protected those who did homage to her and recognized her sway.
- in *Illiad* 14. 197-221, *Hera* devises a plan to deceive Zeus. She was on the Archaeans' side, as Paris, a Trojan (I think), decided that Aprodite was the most beautiful goddess. She beautifies herself in the private chamber that her son *Hepaestus* built her, and tricked Aphrodite into giving her own embroidered breast band to her by saying she wanted to bring *Ocean* and *Tethys* to stop fighting and bring them closer together. With the help of *Sleep* or *Hypnos*, she tricked Zeus into a deep sleep (*Sleep* agreed to this because *Hera* promised to make Pasithee his wife, who he fancied) Because of this distraction, she was able to get the Greeks to regain the upper hand in the *Trojan War.*
### myth of Pygmalion
- *Pygmalion* was a king of the island of Kypros (Cyprus) who fell in love with an ivory statue of the goddess Aphrodite. In answer to his prayers the statue was brought to life and afterwards became his wife.
- Pygmalion saw these women [the Propoitides who had become prostitutes,] waste their lives in wretched shame, and critical of faults which nature had so deeply planted through their female hearts, he lived in preference, for many years unmarried. But while he was single, with consummate skill, he carved a statue out of snow-white ivory, and gave to it exquisite beauty, which no woman of the world has ever equalled: she was so beautiful, he fell in love with his creation.
